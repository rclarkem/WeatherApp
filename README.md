## Project Description

#### Overview:

The idea is to implement a simple single-page application (SPA) using the React.js.

#### Challenges:

Using React's state and props system and utilizing the Geolocation API.

#### Purpose

This project gives the user a message of 'Burr, it is chilly" or "Let's go to the beach" depending on the season they are in based on their geolocation.

## Motivation

I wanted to make a basic frontend UI that solidified my knowledge of React and to learn how to use the Geolocation API.
